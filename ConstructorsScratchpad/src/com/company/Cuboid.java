// 2. Write a class with the name Cuboid that extends Rectangle class. The class needs one field (instance variable)
//    with name height of type double.
//
//        The class needs to have one constructor with three parameters width, length, and height all of type double.
//        It needs to call parent constructor and initialize a height field.
//
//        In case the height parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
//
//        Write the following methods (instance methods):
//        * Method named getHeight without any parameters, it needs to return the value of height field.
//        * Method named getVolume without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated volume. To calculate volume
//        multiply the area with height.
